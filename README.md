## üéØ Project Overview
The prototype showcases how advanced **computer vision** and **speech processing** can be combined with **industrial automation systems** for next-generation human‚Äìmachine interaction (HMI).  
- **Facial Recognition** ‚Äî identifies and verifies personnel in front of the SCADA station camera.  
- **Speech Recognition** ‚Äî processes verbal commands for selected SCADA actions.  
- **SCADA Connectivity** ‚Äî Python scripts communicate with Siemens PLCs via the `python-snap7` library.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Real-time Facial Recognition**  
  - Detects and recognizes registered personnel using standard webcams.  
  - Security-enhancing access layer for SCADA workstations.  

- **Speech-to-Command Interface**  
  - Converts spoken commands into text with Python speech libraries.  
  - Maps recognized commands to SCADA operations (start, stop, monitor).  

- **Seamless Siemens Integration**  
  - Communication layer built on `python-snap7`.  
  - Reads/writes PLC tags to trigger actions or confirm status.  

- **Prototype Use Case**  
  - Demonstrated at a Siemens Event as a **proof of concept** for intelligent operator interfaces.
